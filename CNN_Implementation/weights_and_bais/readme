# Weights and Biases Project Setup

This guide will help you get started with tracking and visualizing your machine learning experiments using Weights and Biases (W&B).

## Table of Contents

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- An existing machine learning project (if you don't have one, you can start with a sample project)
- A Weights and Biases account (sign up at [https://wandb.ai](https://wandb.ai))

## Installation
First, install the `wandb` library using pip:

## Logging In
Once you run the code. You will be required to login.
RUN wandb login

Once logged in. You can run this code and all the mertics will be logged on weights and bias library

















THIS DIRECTORY CONTAINS 2 FILES. 

A. SWEEP IMPLEMNTATION:

This file contains the CNN model training code for sweep generation. I have commented where there were chnages in the code. Sweep allows us to run the model and search for the best hyper parameters. All the parameters are logged in a sweep run.

B. WANDB IMPLEMENTATION:

This file contains the CNN model training with using weights and biases to log all the accuracy metrics and confusion metrix. A report is finally generated in the end showing the model outputs on the testing data.
