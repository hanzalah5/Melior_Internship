THIS DIRECTORY CONTAINS 2 FILES. 

A. SWEEP IMPLEMNTATION:

This file contains the CNN model training code for sweep generation. I have commented where there were chnages in the code. Sweep allows us to run the model and search for the best hyper parameters. All the parameters are logged in a sweep run.

B. WANDB IMPLEMENTATION:

This file contains the CNN model training with using weights and biases to log all the accuracy metrics and confusion metrix. A report is finally generated in the end showing the model outputs on the testing data.
